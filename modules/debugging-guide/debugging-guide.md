### Debugging / CART 253 / Pippin Barr

# Debugging guide

---

## Programming doesn't work

- You may have noticed that when you write programs they don't work
- You may have noticed this happens all the time
- You may have noticed that the default state of a program is: not working
- And if it's working its default state is: not doing what you wanted
--

We constantly need to __debug__ our work

---

## Bugs! Gross!

- We can think of a "bug" as basically any problem with our program
- Some of them are __syntax errors__ where we've typed something that doesn't make sense to JavaScript
- And the worst ones of all are the errors in __behaviour__, where the program itself "works" (it runs), but it doesn't behave correctly (maybe it's a blank screen, maybe something isn't displaying, maybe something is in the wrong place, etc.)

---

## Debugging!

- Debugging is the process of going through our code and getting rid of all the bugs
- Programming basically __is__ debugging
- Debugging is actually pretty fun once you get used to it
- One big part of debugging is just knowing the kinds of things that can go wrong
- Another big part of debugging is have strategies for finding where those things are

---

## Syntax

- Syntax errors are usually the easiest to fix because the JavaScript Console notices them for you
- It's not too bad at warning you about most of the common syntax errors
- And a lot of the time its error messages can even be pretty helpful...

---

## ReferenceErrors from typos

```javascript
let meaningOfLife = 42;
console.log(meaningOfLif);
```

.hi[Uncaught ReferenceError: meaningOfLif is not defined]

```javascript
backgroun(0);
```

.hi[Uncaught ReferenceError: backgroun is not defined]

---

## Object-oriented ReferenceErrors

```javascript
let car = new Car();
```

.hi[Uncaught ReferenceError: Car is not defined]

- This may mean we never created a `Car` class
- Or we accidentally didn't call its constructor function `Car()`
- Or we didn't add a `<script>` tag to include the class file in our project

---

## Non-existent functions

```javascript
solveAllMyProblemsForever();
```

.hi[Uncaught ReferenceError: solveAllMyProblemsForever is not defined]

---

## Weird parameters

```javascript
rect("draw a rectangle over there");
```

.hi[No error! Damn.]

```javascript
background(true);
```

.hi[Error: [object Arguments]is not a valid color representation.]

- So you only occasionally get an actual error message when you put incorrect parameters into a function
- This is a result of JavaScript's __coercion__ of values - it tries to help out by converting your values into the "right kind of thing"

---

## Incorrect parameters

```javascript
background("a nice sea green");
```

.hi[No error! Damn.]

- You __can__ give a string to `background()` but it has to specify a correct color name (like "red" or "cyan") to actually work

---

## Type mismatch

```javascript
let meaningOfLife = 3.14159;
meaningOfLife = "Be excellent to each other.";
meaningOfLife = false;
```

.hi[No error! Damn.]

- As we know, JavaScript lets us put __any__ kind of value into __any__ variable without checking if it's the right kind of thing

---

## Non-existent methods

```javascript
let meaningOfLife = 42;
meaningOfLife.tellMeWhatYouAreInADream();
```

.hi[Uncaught TypeError: meaningOfLife.tellMeWhatYouAreInADream is not a function]

- If try to call a non-existent method of any variable (including an object), you get a TypeError, which is helpful

---

## Missing opening curly brackets

```javascript
let curlyMissing = true;
if (curlyMissing)
  console.log("Oopsie-daisy!");
}
```

.hi[Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }]

- JavaScript notices that you have a __closing__ curly bracket that doesn't match a previously __opened__ curly bracket
- It tells you where the unexpected closing one is, but you then have to find where you forgot to open one

---

## Missing closing curly brackets


```
let curlyMissing = true;
if (curlyMissing) {
  console.log("Oopsie-daisy!");
```

.hi[Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input]

- If you fail to close one of your curly brackets JavaScript won't notice until it reaches the __end of the file__, at which point it will realize that at some point you didn't close one of your curlies
- It doesn't know which one
- You have to go back through your program to look for it!

---

## Finding missing curlies

- Generally speaking your best friend in finding missing curly brackets is...
- ... __don't forget to put your curly brackets in the correct places and make sure they match__
--

- But, if you do leave one out, your best friend is...
- Auto Indenting your code with atom-beautify (or similar)
- If you indent all your code you will likely be able to see visually where the indenting gets weird and unexpected - your problem is likely around there.

---

## Missing opening parenthesis

```
if (100 < 200) && (200 < 300)) {
  console.log("Seems legit.");
}
```

.hi[Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &&]

```
background(random0,1));
```

.hi[Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )]

- When you forget to open a parenthesis, JavaScript will tell you the first moment it sees something unexpected because of that
- The thing it sees will tend to be very close to wherever you forgot to open the parentheses

---

## Missing closing parenthesis

```
if ((100 < 200) && (200 < 300) {
  console.log("Seems legit.");
}
```

.hi[Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {]

- Again JavaScript tells you the first thing it sees as weird
- And again it will often be near where the problem is

```
background(random(0,1);
```  

.hi[Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list]

- This one is super helpful!!

---

## `=` instead of `===`

```javascript
let x = 0;
if (x = 0) {
 console.log("I feel good about this.");
}
```

.hi[No error!]

- This is because JavaScript will __evaluate__ `x = 0` in the conditional
- It evaluates to the result of that instruction, which is `0`
- An `0` is __coerced__ (converted) to `false`
- And so we just never see the message
- Be careful!

---

## `===` instead of `=`

```javascript
let x === 0;
if (x === 0) {
 console.log("I feel good about this.");
}
```

.hi[Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ===]

- Because you can't have `===` when __declaring__ a variable

```javascript
let x;
x === 0;
if (x === 0) {
 console.log("I feel good about this.");
}
```

.hi[No error!]

- Because JavaScript evaluated `x === 0;`, it's `false`, and then it moves on.

---

## There are more.

- You will undoubtedly run into other errors as you write more complicated programs
- It's a real mixed bag in terms of whether you will get an error message or not
- Hugely it comes down to experiencing every kind of error and remembering the kinds of things that happen
- Once you have that list in your head, it's a lot easier to fix them
- Or, even better, begin to be more cautious about the kinds of coding that cause them in the first place (__match your curly brackets!!!__)

---

## Okay, my program works now...

__... but it doesn't, you know... work.__

- As we all know, just fixing all the errors in a program isn't enough
- Once we've done that we need to fix all the errors we wrote in __perfectly good code__

---

## The basic process

0. Run your program
0. Notice it doesn't do what you expected (__testing__)
0. Figure out what is causing the problem (__debugging__)
0. Fix the problem (__debugging__)
0. Go to 1 (begin weeping around iteration 10 or so)

---

## Testing

- Because you write your own code, __testing__ is a little bit easier than it would be for someone else
- You __know__ what your program is meant to do, so you __know__ when it's not doing that
- As your programs get more complicated, though, you do need to be more __thorough__ with testing
- And with __interactive__ media someone other than you will use it and they will do weird things you might not have thought of (like pressing every key at once, head-butting the microphone, ...)
- This is why it's good to watch other people test your work

---

## Debugging

- Once you run into a problem in your code it's a good idea to think about what __kind__ of problem it is
- Especially in relation to your own code
- This will allow you to __find__ the location of the problem more easily
- If it's a problem with the way a Predator is moving, you can probably start out looking in the `Predator` class, maybe in the `handleInput()` or `move()` methods
- If the Prey aren't being eaten, it should be something to do with the `handleEating()` method in the `Predator` class (including it not being called in the main program, for instance)
- Be a detective

---

## Debugging

There are a few basic things you can do to make your life of debugging easier:

* __Simplify__ your code
* Send yourself __messages__
* __Show it__ to someone else
* Take a __break__

---

## Simplify

- One beauty of the __modularity__ we get from functions and object-oriented programming is that we can more easily __simplify__ our work
- For example, if we have a problem with our Prey, we could simplify the main program to just have __no Prey__ at all
- If removing the Prey __solves__ the problem, we know the issue is somewhere in the code we removed
- If this __doesn't__ solve the problem, we've got __much less code to look at__ because it can only be in the code we've left in the program!
- Repeating this process will eventually lead us to the truth!

???

- A key to this approach is being able to think of your program as being made of up parts
- Those parts can (often) exist independently, which makes them easier to fix

---

```javascript
function draw() {
  // Clear the background to black
  background(0);

  // Handle input for the tiger
  tiger.handleInput();

  // Move all the "animals"
  tiger.move();
  // antelope.move();
  // zebra.move();
  // bee.move();

  // Handle the tiger eating any of the prey
  // tiger.handleEating(antelope);
  // tiger.handleEating(zebra);
  // tiger.handleEating(bee);

  // Display all the "animals"
  tiger.display();
  // antelope.display();
  // zebra.display();
  // bee.display();
}
```

---

## Extreme simplifying

- An extreme version of the __simplify__ approach is to comment out __everything__
- And then gradually add things back in __one by one__
- Until the problem finally comes up
- At that point you know that the thing you just added is __part of the problem__
- e.g. You could start with nothing, then add the line that creates a Predator, then add the `background()` instruction, then add the `handleInput()` for the Predator, etc...

---

## Messages

- Easily the most common way that I personally do debugging is by sending __messages__ inside the code
- The easiest way to do this is by using `console.log()` to write messages onto the console
- I use it for two main things:
  - Print a message to __show that the program reached a certain point__
  - Print out the __values of variables__ to check if they're reasonable, to watch them change, etc.

---

`Prey.js`:
```javascript
reset() {
  console.log("Prey reset() called");
  this.x = random(0, width);
  this.y = random(0, height);
  this.health = this.maxHealth;
  this.radius = this.health;
}
```

- If something weird is happening with the Prey not resetting properly one of the first things I would do is put a `console.log()` in the `reset()` method of the Prey class to see if it's being called
- If that message __does not appear__ when it should, we know the function is not being called
- If that message __does appear__ then the resetting problem is somewhere else

---

```javascript
handleEating(prey) {
  console.log("Predator handleEating() called")
  let d = dist(this.x, this.y, prey.x, prey.y);
  console.log("Distance to Prey is " + d);
  if (d < this.radius + prey.radius) {
    console.log("Prey is in range!");
    this.health += this.healthGainPerEat;
    this.health = constrain(this.health, 0, this.maxHealth);
    prey.health -= this.healthGainPerEat;
    console.log("Prey health is now: " + prey.health);
    if (prey.health < 0) {
      console.log("Prey died!");
      prey.reset();
    }
  }
}
```

- Maybe the Prey is not resetting because of something in `handleEating()`?
- One way to monitor this is to put `console.log()` messages in the `handleEating()` method that lets us know what is happening in there specifically
- By running the game and monitoring these messages, we may be able to see a problem

---

## Show it

- You're surrounded by people who know how to program to varying degrees
- If you're totally stuck on a weird bug, show it to someone else
- The process of __explaining__ what is going wrong will often trigger a realization of how to __fix__ it!
- This can even work if you just verbally explain your code __to yourself__

---

## Take a break

- You have probably experienced the obsession of trying to fix a bug for multiple hours with no luck
- It's very tempting and even perversely "easy" to just keep going at it
- But you can end up totally exhausted and not able to think straight
- Taking a break, even a short one, is often a great way to suddenly come up with the answer

---

## Bonus: Ask for help

- It is a great instinct to want to work through all the problems in your code on your own, you'll learn a lot
- But it's important, too, to remember that we're here to __learn__ how to program, not to already be good at it
- So if you're struggling, just ask for help
- There is studio time, office hours, email, latent psychic powers: many ways to reach out

---

## Bonus: Call it a feature!

- One of the dark arts of programming is to sometimes decide that an element of your program that doesn't work the way you want is actually... __what you wanted__
- This is probably only a good idea if you __understand__ why it doesn't work
- But it can be an interesting design process to consider: __not all unexpected behavior in your code is necessarily bad__
- So long as you (eventually) understand it
