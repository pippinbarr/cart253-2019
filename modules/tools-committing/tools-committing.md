# Committing

---

## In this module

- Remembering the version control workflow
- Committing and commit messages

---

## The version control workflow

1. You __make some changes to your project in your local folder__. Reaching some sort of defined goal perhaps, getting something specific working.
--

2. You __write a descriptive message__ and then __commit your changes to the local repository__ using GitHub Desktop. This stores this newest version of the project in the repository.
--

3. You __push your changes to the remote repository__ on github.com using GitHub Desktop. This makes sure your newest version is also safe in the "cloud".

## "When should I commit?"

- There's no one answer
- At a minimum you should commit __when you've made some important change__ (the program is different in some way from the way it was)
- When possible you should commit __working versions of your project__ (no bugs that break the whole thing)
- In the end, __you probably can't commit too often__ (obviously not after each new letter you type in, but it's fine to commit a single new line of code for example, or because you corrected a typo)

---

## "What should I write in my commit message?"

- The simple answer to this is: __write what you did__
- If you added new code that lets the player control their avatar with the mouse, then "Added mouse controls for avatar"
- If you removed a bunch of `console.log()` messages you don't need any more, then "Removed excess debugging messages"
- If you changed a method that controls the probability of a bomb exploding, then "Changed bomb explosion probabilities"
- ... and so on.

---

## "What should I write in my commit message?"

- __Write what you did__
- Write it __clearly and simply__ (no need to write an essay)
- Help yourself by __committing every time you make a single important change__ (so you know exactly what to write about)
