# Exercise 7 - Project 3 Prototype 1

__Grade__: 1.25% of final grade (see grading guidelines at bottom)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on the day of class on week of 11 November 2018.

## Brief

Use this exercise to begin work on Project 3. You should hand in a __short PDF design document__ for the project alongside a __small working prototype__ of some aspect of the project. You can explore aesthetics, a specific interaction, a visual effect, an approach to sound, or anything else that will help you get started on actually making the project.

__Read the [Project 3](../projects/Project-3.md) brief to make sure you work in the right direction.__

(Note that you do not have to __stick__ with the idea you present in this exercise, it's an opportunity to explore a possibility.)

## Learning objectives

- Conceptualising and designing a specific project of your own
- Scoping your prototype to make sure it is of an appropriate size to get done in a week


## Requirements

You will submit a design document and a working prototype.

The __design document PDF__ should include
- a short description of your vision for the project
- initial ideas about what your technical approach will be (what classes will you create? how will you use arrays? sound? images? etc.)
- a visual sketch of what your program will look like (can be a scan of pencil on paper, can make it in photoshops, whatever suits)

The __prototype__  should
- be a working version of some aspect of your project
- ideally be interactive, but at least involve actual creative programming (e.g. not just a bunch of images being displayed on the screen)

It is completely fine to start from any of the pre-existing code we've seen previously so long as you make that clear and give a reference in the comments of your prototype.


## Submission

You will submit this exercise as a __comment__ on an __Issue__ on the course repository here:

https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2019/issues

(Click on the Issue with the name of the exercise and your section letter and follow the instructions.)


## Grading

Grading for this exercise is pass/fail will consider the following categories:

- __Implementation__ (40%)- the code runs, meets the challenges set, includes any further changes, has no errors, is interesting/creative, etc. Likewise, the document is clear, well-written, and meets the brief.
- __Creativity__ (30%) - Uses code to create an interesting and expressive interpretation of the brief for the user. Has a clear point of view and conveys it consistently. Uses code in surprising ways to create new experiences. Likewise, the document indicates serious thought has gone into the project idea.
- __Style__ (30%) - the code is well-commented, well-formatted and indented, uses good names for variables, functions, classes, etc., and has a good number of commits with well-written commit messages (commits include the prefix "EX7:").
