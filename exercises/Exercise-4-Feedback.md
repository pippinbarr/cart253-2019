# Exercise 4 Feedback

## Submission

## Naming

- Still occasional naming issues, notably not using camelCase (getting rarer)

## Commenting

## Commits

- Very occasional lack of prefix, but getting much better

## Style

- Still occasional excess whitespace (getting rarer)
- Still occasional indenting issues (getting rarer)

## Other

- When tracking score for each paddle it would make most sense to have a `score` property as part of the Paddle objects
- Many people didn't give the ball a random y velocity on relaunch, which was part of the challenges
