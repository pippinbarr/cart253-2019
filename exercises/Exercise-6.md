# Exercise 6 - Debugging Predator-Prey

__Grade__: 1.25% of final grade (see grading guidelines at bottom)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on the day of class on week of 28 October 2019.

## Brief

Debug the provided broken version of Predator-Prey. All errors will be in the JavaScript files (not in CSS or HTML). There are approximately 30 errors across the three JavaScript files.

## Learning objectives

- Debugging!

## Commenting your changes clearly

For this exercise you will need to indicate where your fixes were made. In this case place the comment `//////////////// FIXED` either __before__ or __next to__ any fixed line of code.

## Challenges

This week the challenge is to debug broken code. So download the starting code and debug it. This will involve both fixing syntax errors in the code that break the program, and fixing behavioral errors in the code that prevent it from working correctly. Do not just read the code and fix things as you see them, follow this methodical approach to make sure you're really practicing a debugging workflow:

Here are the rules:

0. __Make sure you have your JavaScript console open at all times.__
0. Fix each error/problem __individually__ and then __commit__ and __push__ the change
0. When you find a syntax error, fix it, add the "fixed" comment, commit it with a message describing the problem and the fix, and push)
0. When you have no syntax errors left and the game runs, determine the current problem with its behavior, find the cause, fix it, add the "fixed" comment, commit it with a message describing the problem and fix, and push
0. Keep going until the game plays like the original

This means you will have __one commit per error in the code__. __Make sure you commit each fix individually__ because your pass/fail grade will be assessed based on the number of fixes you commit.

## Submission

You will submit this exercise as a __comment__ on an __Issue__ on the course repository here:

(Click on the Issue with the name of the exercise and your section letter and follow the instructions.)


## Grading

Pass/fail based on finding and fixing the significant majority of the errors present in the code. (Missing one or two toward the end may be acceptable.)
