# Exercise 8 - Project 3 Prototype 2

__Grade__: 1.25% of final grade (see grading guidelines at bottom)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on the day of class on week of 18 November 2018.

## Brief

__EITHER__

Create a new and different prototype for a distinct part of Project 3 than your Exercise 7 prototype.

__OR__

Significantly extend your Exercise 7 prototype to build further toward your goals.

---

__Either way, the prototype for Exercise 8 must be interactive.__

__Read the [Project 3](../projects/Project-3.md) brief to make sure you work in the right direction.__

(Note that you do not have to __stick__ with the idea you present in this exercise, it's an opportunity to explore a possibility.)

## Learning objectives

- Conceptualizing and designing a specific project of your own

## Requirements

For this exercise you only need to submit a working prototype.

The __prototype__  should
- be a working version of some aspect of your project
- be interactive

It is completely fine to start from any of the pre-existing code we've seen previously so long as you make that clear and give a reference in the comments of your prototype.


## Submission

You will submit this exercise as a __comment__ on an __Issue__ on the course repository here:

https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2019/issues

(Click on the Issue with the name of the exercise and your section letter and follow the instructions.)


## Grading

Grading for this exercise is pass/fail will consider the following categories:

- __Implementation__ (40%) - the code runs, meets the challenges set, includes any further changes, has no errors, is interesting/creative, etc. Likewise, the document is clear, well-written, and meets the brief.
- __Creativity__ (30%) - Uses code to create an interesting and expressive interpretation of the brief for the user. Has a clear point of view and conveys it consistently. Uses code in surprising ways to create new experiences. Likewise, the document indicates serious thought has gone into the project idea.
- __Style__ (30%) - the code is well-commented, well-formatted and indented, uses good names for variables, functions, classes, etc., and has a good number of commits with well-written commit messages (commits include the prefix "EX8:").
